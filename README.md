# Pretty Localhost is Pretty

Tired of the default and ugly localhost? Just install (clone) this into your localhost directory and be happy.

## How to Install

Just clone this repository inside your localhost folder.

For example, in OS X:

    cd ~/Sites
    git clone https://github.com/edmundojr/localhost.git

All the files are dot files â€“ invisible for the Finder.

## TO DO

- add favicons support
- add keyboard navigation
- add support for themes
- options menu (change theme, show invisible files, et cetera)
- path bar (?)
- turn this in a Chrome Extension (?)
