# Pretty Localhost is Pretty

I never liked the default styling of localhost (directory index), so I redesign it.

| --- | --- |

## Installing

1. Download the repository and move the .dot files to your localhost directory ‚Äì on OS X, that will be the `Sites` folder.
2. Done!

To toggle visibility of .dot's files, do this on Terminal:
```sh
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool TRUE && killall Finder
```
To get back to the default behavior, just change `TRUE` to `FALSE`.

## Features

- Responsive
- Sort by name or modification date
- Show/hide hidden files
- Favicons
